## 📖 Overview

**URDF Studio** is a state-of-the-art, web-based visual environment engineered for the seamless creation, manipulation, and export of Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) models. By abstracting the complexities of raw XML authoring into an intuitive graphical interface, it empowers roboticists to focus on design and innovation.

This platform orchestrates the entire robotic modeling lifecycle—from kinematic skeleton definition to high-fidelity geometric detailing and precise hardware specification. Enhanced by **Generative AI**, URDF Studio accelerates prototyping and ensures compatibility with industry-standard simulation ecosystems like MuJoCo.


## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🦴 Advanced Design Modalities

| Mode | Functionality |
|------|-------------|
| **Skeleton** | Rapidly architect kinematic chains (Links & Joints) and define topological relationships with precision. |
| **Detail** | Fine-tune visual aesthetics and collision manifolds, supporting primitive geometries and high-resolution mesh imports (STL/OBJ/DAE). |
| **Hardware** | Specify electromechanical parameters, including actuator selection, torque constraints, and transmission ratios. |

### 🎨 Immersive 3D Workspace

- **High-Fidelity Rendering**: Powered by **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber** with enhanced PBR materials and glossiness for a photorealistic experience.
- **Intuitive Manipulation**: Industry-standard gizmos for precise spatial transformation of robot segments.
- **Visual Analytics**: 
  - Real-time visualization of joint axes and reference frames.
  - Per-link **Center of Mass (CoM)** and **Inertia Tensor** visualization with transparent box indicators.
  - **Highlight Mode**: Toggle between Link and Collision highlighting for precise inspection and editing.
  - **Collision Preview**: High-visibility collision mesh rendering with "DoubleSide" support for easier selection.


### 🔍 AI Inspector

The **AI Inspector** provides comprehensive automated quality assessment of URDF models using industry-standard evaluation criteria:

- **Multi-Category Inspection**: Evaluates six key dimensions:
  - **Physical Plausibility**: Mass, inertia validity, symmetry consistency
  - **Link Frames**: Joint collinearity, axis conventions, waist centering
  - **Assembly Logic**: Actuator mass attribution, linkage placement
  - **Kinematics & Simulation**: Topology validation, joint limits, collision optimization
  - **Hardware Configuration**: Motor specifications, armature configuration
  - **Naming Conventions**: Uniqueness and semantic naming standards

- **Detailed Scoring System**: Each inspection item is scored on a 0-10 scale, with comprehensive reports showing:
  - Overall achievement rate
  - Category-specific scores
  - Individual issue identification with severity levels (error/warning/suggestion)
  - Related link/joint references for easy navigation

- **Interactive Features**:
  - Selective inspection: Choose specific items to check
  - Single-item retest: Re-evaluate specific issues after fixes
  - AI-powered chat: Discuss inspection results and get recommendations
  - PDF export: Download detailed inspection reports

- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress tracking during inspection with detailed item-by-item status

### 📥 Seamless Interoperability

- **Import**: Effortlessly ingest existing projects via ZIP archives containing URDF definitions and mesh assets.
- **Export**: One-click generation of a production-ready robot package:
  - `urdf/`: Standard URDF + Extended URDF (enriched with hardware metadata).
  - `meshes/`: Consolidated directory of all referenced 3D assets.
  - `hardware/`: Automated Bill of Materials (BOM) generation in CSV format.
  - `mujoco/`: Auto-configured XML for immediate simulation in MuJoCo.

### ⚙️ Motor Library

Includes a built-in library of popular robot actuators:
- **Unitree**: Go1, A1, B1 series.
- **RobStride**: RS series.
- *Extensible*: Easily add custom motor specifications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **3D Engine**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, @react-three/drei
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI SDK (supports OpenAI-compatible APIs)
- **Utilities**: JSZip, Lucide React

## 🚀 Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenLegged/URDF-Studio.git
   cd URDF-Studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure API Key (Optional)**
   To use AI features, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   VITE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-proxy-url/v1
   VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=bce/deepseek-v3.2
   ```
   
   **Configuration Details:**
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key or proxy API key
   - `VITE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`: (Optional) Custom API endpoint URL. Defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1` if not set
   - `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL`: (Optional) Model name to use. Defaults to `bce/deepseek-v3.2` if not set
   
   **Example for using a proxy server:**
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-proxy-api-key
   VITE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aiproxy.d-robotics.cc/v1
   VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=bce/deepseek-v3.2
   ```
   
   **Note:** The `.env.local` file is ignored by git and will not be committed to the repository.

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 📝 Usage Guide

1. **Skeleton Mode**: Use the `+` button in the tree view to add child links. Adjust joint origins using the 3D gizmos.
2. **Detail Mode**: Select a link to configure its visual and collision geometry. Upload custom meshes if needed.
3. **Hardware Mode**: Select a joint to assign motors from the library. The system automatically sets limits based on the motor specs.
4. **AI Assistant**: Click the "AI Assistant" button, type your request, and apply the generated changes.
5. **AI Inspector**: Click the "AI审阅" (AI Inspector) button, select inspection items, run comprehensive quality checks, and review detailed reports with scoring.
6. **Export**: Click "Export" to download the full project ZIP.
